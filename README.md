## Documentation for Business Card

I used nathan wrights starter code. I changed the name, and his links to his email and his linked in, to my linked in and personal email. Then, I placed a background of a black background with white specs throughout. This is meant to represent space and will go well with my business card. After not being content with the original background, I settled for another background that was more clear and that bounced off my bussiness card hence why the card is white. The goal was to keep the card simple and centered with a logo that pops.
Later on with the help of my instructor, installed mail icons for linked in and email that upon clicking on the icon, goes directly to its corresponding website. There was some error as one of the mail icons wasn't working properly as it was a coding issue itself which eventually had to be changed to a new icon. I wanted each icon to have a different shape hence why one is a circle and the other is square. Creates a sense of uniquness while also being simple and straight foward.
